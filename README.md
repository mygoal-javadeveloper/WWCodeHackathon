# COVID-19/SARS B-cell Epitope Prediction
## A simple dataset for epitope prediction used in vaccine development

# Introduction about Dataset

Due to spread of COVID-19, vaccine development is being demanded as soon as possible. Despite the importance of data analysis in vaccine development, there are not many simple data sets that data analysts can handle. The B-cell epitope predictions covered by in this dataset, is one of the key research topics in vaccine development. This dataset was developed during the research process and the data contained in it was obtained from [IEDB](<https://www.iedb.org/>) and [UniProt](<https://www.uniprot.org/>). And predicting of epitope regions is beneficial for the design and development of vaccines aimed to induce antigen-specific antibody production. This dataset has 14387 number of rows for all combinations of 14362 peptides and 757 proteins.
